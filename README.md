# Bayesian statistics course 

The programme is designed for U Bordeaux's *Sciences and Environment* Graduate School (with enrollment from students of other graduate schools). 
Requirements are a working knowledge of R, and some basic statistics (analysis of variance and regression). 
The course runs for 10 sessions of 3 hours each, roughly half-lectures half-practicals (TDs, *travaux dirig√©s*), although percentages may vary.

### Programme

1. [Objectives and philosophy of Bayesian statistics](https://github.com/fbarraquand/Bayesian_statistics_course/blob/master/session_1/Bayesian_statistics_1.pdf). TD1 Bayesian estimation of a proportion
2. [Revisiting the ANOVA in a Bayesian framework](https://github.com/fbarraquand/Bayesian_statistics_course/blob/master/session_2/Bayesian_statistics_2.pdf). TD2 Getting acquainted with software (JAGS), coding the first models
3. [Markov Chain Monte Carlo](https://github.com/fbarraquand/Bayesian_statistics_course/blob/master/session_3/Bayesian_statistics_3.pdf) (i.e., algorithms for Bayesian statistics). Practicals within the course: Monte Carlo integration, rejection sampling, Metropolis algorithm
4. [From fixed to random effects, introduction to mixed models](https://github.com/fbarraquand/Bayesian_statistics_course/blob/master/session_4/Bayesian_statistics_4.pdf). TD4 variance partitioning (with thorough convergence diagnostics). 
5. [Mixed models. A hint of Poisson GLMs](https://github.com/fbarraquand/Bayesian_statistics_course/blob/master/session_5/Bayesian_statistics_5.pdf). TD5 mixed models following up on TD4 (done first)
6. [Generalized linear models for counts](https://github.com/fbarraquand/Bayesian_statistics_course/blob/master/session_6/Bayesian_statistics_6.pdf). TD6 GLM(Ms) Poisson LN (fitting diagnostics, posterior predictive checks). 
7. Binomial/Bernoulli GLM(Ms) (importance of priors in original and transformed scale).
8. Nonlinear models (organism growth, population growth,...). TD7 Simulation and estimation of nonlinear dynamics. 
9. Latent variable models (e.g. occupancy models (0/1), capture - recapture). TD8 organism / taxon survival (evolution). 
10. Model selection in a Bayesian setting.
